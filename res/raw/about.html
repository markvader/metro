<p>Thank you for trying Metro Belfast.</p>
<p><strong>About the software?</strong></p>
<p>Metro Belfast is based on an open-source transport project called Sydtrans for the bus, train and ferry timetables in Sydney.  It was coded by a developer called Braveo Huang in 2009. You can find out more information about the project and contact the developer at the following addresses.</p>
<p><strong>Contact</strong>: <a href="mailto:braveo.huang@gmail.com">braveo.huang@gmail.com</a><br />
  <strong>Website</strong>: <a href="http://sydtrans.googlecode.com">http://sydtrans.googlecode.com</a></p>
<p>Translink the public body responsible for bus and trains within Northern Ireland have been behind the times in proving timetables for modern technology like mobile phones.</p>
<p><strong>Why Metro Belfast?</strong></p>
<p>I have been an android user for the past year or so and while coming from a non-IT profession most of my life is heavily involved in the tech world.  I travel almost everyday by Translinks metro bus service into the city. Hardcopies of timetables are not convenient to carry with users and a net connection is not always available. A handy digitised timetable can help me, and hopefully will for other passengers.</p>
<p><strong>Something more?</strong></p>
<p>Metro Belfast and Sydtrans the project it is based on are designed to be flexible. Timetables for other cities or countries are possible. The software is compatable with timetable for Sydney and Melbourne and now for the metro bus service in Belfast (only a few routes to start but more being added all the time. Hopefully I will have time to expand to all of NI services.  Users can download timetables manually, or automatically from the project website.</p>
<p>If you find some error with the timetable for Belfast, please tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Even more?</strong></p>
<p>I hope to add features involving GPS in the near future. Stay tuned</p>
